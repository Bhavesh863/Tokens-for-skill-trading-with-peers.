SkillTradingToken (SKILL)

## Project Description
SkillTradingToken is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to trade skills and services using an ERC20-based token. This platform allows skill providers to offer their expertise at a specified rate per hour, while consumers can engage with them by initiating trades. The system ensures transparency and security for both parties and enables the usage of tokens to facilitate skill-based transactions.

## Project Vision
The vision of SkillTradingToken is to create a decentralized marketplace for skills, where individuals can directly trade their time and expertise using blockchain technology. This platform aims to eliminate intermediaries, reduce transaction costs, and ensure that all parties involved in a trade are treated fairly and transparently.

We envision this platform being expanded to support various industries and skills, where users can interact with one another globally in a trusted environment.

## Key Features

- **Skill Registration:** Users can register and offer skills with descriptions and hourly rates. Each skill has a unique identifier and can be deactivated when no longer available.
  
- **Trade Initiation:** Consumers can initiate a trade by selecting a skill, specifying a provider, and defining the duration. The trade amount is automatically calculated based on the provider's rate per hour and the duration of the trade.

- **Secure Transactions:** SkillTrade utilizes the ERC20 token (SKILL) to facilitate transactions. Users must have sufficient balance to initiate a trade. The contract ensures safe transfers, preventing unauthorized access and transactions.

- **Trade Completion:** Once a trade is concluded, the service provider receives the total amount paid by the consumer. Only the receiver (consumer) can complete the trade.

- **Dispute Resolution:** In case of any issues during the trade, either party (provider or receiver) can dispute the trade, preventing further actions until resolution.

- **Skill Management:** Users can deactivate their skills when they are no longer offering them. Each skill has a status indicating whether it is active or inactive.

- **ERC20 Compliance:** The project adheres to the ERC20 standard, enabling users to trade and transfer the Skill tokens in the broader Ethereum ecosystem.
